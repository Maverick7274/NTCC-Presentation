# DevOps

* DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops).
* It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

---

# Git

* Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

* It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

---

# GitHub

* GitHub is a global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.

* It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, plus its own features.

---

# Docker

* Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

* Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files.

---

# Kubernetes

* Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.

* It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

---

# Jenkins

* Jenkins is a free and open source automation server.

* It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery.

---

# Agile Methodology

* Agile methodology adopts an iterative and incremental approach to software development, breaking the process into smaller sprints for continuous improvement and adaptability.

* Agile emphasizes close collaboration with customers or product owners, actively seeking their feedback to ensure the delivered product meets their needs and expectations.
